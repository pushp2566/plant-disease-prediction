# **Plant Disease Prediction using CNN and Deep Learning**

This repository contains a project for building an **Image Classifier** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to predict plant diseases. The project is implemented using **Python** and utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve accurate classification.

## **Dataset**
The model is trained using the **PlantVillage dataset**, which contains a vast collection of plant leaf images with corresponding disease labels. The dataset is available on Kaggle: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a plant is diseased or healthy by analyzing images of its leaves. The **CNN architecture** used in this project is optimized for image classification tasks, making it well-suited for detecting plant diseases.

## **Key Features**
- Utilizes CNN for efficient image classification
- Trained on a comprehensive plant disease dataset
- Provides accurate predictions for various plant diseases
- High accuracy achieved through deep learning techniques
- Real-time prediction using the trained model

## **Model Architecture**
The **CNN model** consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers. The final dense layers predict the probability of each disease category. The model is trained using **cross-entropy loss** and optimized using the **Adam optimizer**.

## **Results**
The model achieves **high accuracy** in predicting plant diseases and is tested on various samples from the **PlantVillage dataset**.
